Setting up the development environment
---
* Download TIC-80 pro (I can help with the pro)
* Open TIC-80
* Symlink this repo so tic80 knows where it is:
   * `ln -s ~/git/driftwinds ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.nesbox.tic/TIC-80/driftwinds`
* `cd driftwinds`
* `load driftwinds.lua`
* âŒ˜R `run`, `edit`
* F1-5 to switch editors in edit mode
